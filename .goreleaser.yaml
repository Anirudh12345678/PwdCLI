# before are hooks that will be run before any builds are done, so good to put install scripts and stuff that your builds need here
before:
    hooks:
        # Remove unused packaged from the build process
        - go mod tidy
        # You may remove this if you don't use go modules - Downloads all modules specified in go.mod
        - go mod download
# buids. This is very basic, but there is a ton of customization you can do here.
